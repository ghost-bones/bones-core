# Bones for Ghost CMS
Bones for Ghost is a commercial boilerplate theme for web developers to create sites and themes for clients and commercial sale. 

# Purpose of the Theme
When we started our journey to transition to use Ghost CMS as our primary content management system for client jobs we found it difficult to find Ghost themes that are outside of Magazine and Blogging sites. 

This theme is focused on assisting developers to create themes for commercial purpose such as a business or organisation.

# What Bones for Ghost is NOT
It is not a full theme that can be installed on any Ghost CMS, it is designed to be a starting point for other theme development while being modular enough to allow you to update your themes core technology as technology develops and industry requirements change.

While posts are apart of the theme this is not a starting point for Magazine/Blogging style themes.

# How to Use
To start using Bones for Ghost start by cloning this repository. 

In your terminal use ```git clone https://github.com/ghost-bones/bones-core.git ```

# The future
It is our hope that through the development of this theme core and an accompanying CLI that we can allow developers to quickly provision a theme core as well as any additional required custome pages and posts.
